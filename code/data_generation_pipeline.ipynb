    "# ASQ-PHI: Synthetic Clinical Query Generation Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements the generation pipeline for **ASQ-PHI** (Adversarial Synthetic Queries for Protected Health Information de-identification), a benchmark dataset of 1,051 fully synthetic clinical search queries designed to stress test HIPAA-compliant de-identification software.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The problem this solves:** Large Language Models (LLMs) running inside HIPAA Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) can legally process PHI, but any query sent to external tools (web search APIs, MCP servers, medical databases) must be de-identified first. Current de-identification systems were trained on EHR notes, not search queries, leading to both PHI leakage and over-redaction of clinically essential information when tested on search queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this notebook does:** Generates synthetic clinical queries with ground truth PHI annotations to test whether de-identification systems can remove identifiers while preserving clinical utility.\n",

    "All content is 100% synthetic. No real patient data were used.\n",

    "- Python 3.12 or newer  \n",
    "- Azure OpenAI Service (GPT-4o deployment recommended)  \n",
    "- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`  \n",
    "- Environment variables set via `code/.env` (see `code/.env.example`):  \n",
    "  - `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY_4o`  \n",
    "  - `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT_4o`  \n",

    "## How to Use This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set up configuration**  \n",
    "   Create `code/.env` from `code/.env.example` and fill in your Azure OpenAI credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run the pipeline**  \n",
    "   Execute cells from top to bottom. The notebook will:\n",
    "   - Initialize the Azure OpenAI client  \n",
    "   - Generate synthetic queries with `generate_phi_queries(n=1051)`  \n",
    "   - Write output to `synthetic_clinical_queries.txt` in the format:\n",
    "```\n",
    "     ===QUERY===\n",
    "     [query text]\n",
    "     ===PHI_TAGS===\n",
    "     {\"identifier_type\": \"TYPE\", \"value\": \"...\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "   - Validate dataset quality with `validate_dataset()` (hard negative ratio, mean PHI per query, malformed entries)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Review outputs**  \n",
    "   Check `synthetic_clinical_queries.txt` for the generated dataset and validation summary statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Customizing for Domain-Specific Variants\n",
    "\n",
    "ASQ-PHI is designed to be adapted for any clinical workflow where queries contain PHI and require external tools. To create a domain-focused variant (oncology, cardiology, pediatrics, etc.):\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adaptation Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Edit the few-shot examples**  \n",
    "   Scroll to the `PHI_QUERY_SYSTEM_PROMPT` cell and locate section **\"7. Correctly Formatted Examples\"**.  \n",
    "   Replace the three example queries with cases reflecting your target domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Customize by:**\n",
    "   - **Specialty**: Tumor staging queries, cardiac imaging requests, neonatal protocols  \n",
    "   - **Setting**: Inpatient wards, outpatient clinics, telemedicine, home health  \n",
    "   - **PHI distribution**: Adjust identifier types or densities for specific use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Regenerate and validate**  \n",
    "   Rerun `generate_phi_queries(n=...)` and `validate_dataset()`. The output will follow the same format but reflect your specialized clinical context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Oncology variant**: Queries about chemotherapy regimens, tumor markers, staging systems  \n",
    "- **Pediatrics variant**: Growth chart lookups, vaccination schedules, developmental milestones  \n",
    "- **Emergency medicine variant**: Triage protocols, toxicology databases, trauma guidelines  \n",
    "- **Telemedicine variant**: Remote consultation queries, home monitoring data, virtual care workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a new benchmark with identical structure and validation checks but optimized for your specific HIPAA-compliant tool integration scenario."
